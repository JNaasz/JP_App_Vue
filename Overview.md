# Remaloo

**What:** 

As a dog owner I want a way to track progress we make with training.
I want to be able to see when I tracked a training and when my partner tracked a training.
I want to be able to add new training commands as we develop new ones.
I want to see metrics for when we've tracked training (days of the week, what we worked on the most etc.)
I want to gamify it so my partner and I can compete to hopefully inspire us to both work on training.
I want a calendar to track any appiontments he might have.
