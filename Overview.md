Task Tracking:
* Dog Training
* Plant H20 Schedule
* Meal Prep (later)
* Calendar (for each) with daily reminder of days events

Thoughts:
Start with one section at a time (Dog, then Plant)
Idea is to have a different credentials file for P and J so that we can have our own spreadsheets for tracking things that are not shared.

What:
As a user, I want an app that I can share with my partner so that we can track different things together. 

The app should be accessible only by us and we should be able to see what the other person has entered so we limit redundancy and rework and know what's already been done.

Features:
* Calendar
* Training Tracker
* Plant Watering Schedule
* Meal Prep

Stories:
Create Landing Page:
[ ] Tabs to Navigate between Features
[ ] In Progress Page for any Feature not complete
[ ] Dailty Pop-Up for Calendar Notification (just pop once per day with dummy schedule)
